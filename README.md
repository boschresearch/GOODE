## Purpose of the project

This software is a research prototype, solely developed for and published as
part of the publication cited above. It will neither be maintained nor 
monitored in any way.

## Requirements, how to build, test, install, use, etc.

The code was developed and works with Matlab R2018a. 

Download the bvp Testset from 
https://archimede.dm.uniba.it/~bvpsolvers/testsetbvpsolvers/?page_id=27 
and copy to the folder [external/bvpTestSet](external/bvpTestSet).
Download the code TOM from
https://archimede.dm.uniba.it/~mazzia/mazzia/?page_id=433
and copy to the folder [external/tom](external/tom).

Run the setup.m file to add required folders to the path. The code for the 
GB BVP solver GOODE is in the folder [GPs](GPs). The folder [experiments](experiments) contains
scripts used to produce the results in the paper.
